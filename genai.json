,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":"0","Body":"<p>I am looking for datasets in any domain that has at least three clear, unambiguous time points: prediction, decision, and outcome. This is rather unusual, so please explain the lengthy background to explain just what I'm looking for.</p>\n<p>A close case to what I'm looking for is the famous <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bank Marketing</a> dataset: &quot;The data is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).&quot; Here, the decision of interest would be whether bank agents should call a customer to propose a term deposit or not. This decision is costly; for example, it might cost €5 to €15 per call, depending on how long it lasts. So the entire purpose of the predictive project is to estimate those customers who are likely to say &quot;yes&quot; so the bank can call them and estimate those likely to say &quot;no&quot; so the bank will not waste time and money calling them (and also so the bank does not bother people who are not interested). For everyone who is not predicted to say &quot;yes&quot;, the bank can just send an email offer: while email is much less effective, it costs the bank almost nothing, so they might get a few unexpected subscriptions that way.</p>\n<p>I will use the Bank Marketing dataset as an example to clarify what I am looking for (and why it does not quite meet my needs).</p>\n<p><strong>Prediction (T1).</strong> Most variables will be in Time 1 and are used to predict the outcome. For example, the Bank Marketing dataset has <code>age</code>, <code>job</code>, <code>education</code>, <code>loan</code>, etc. as the main predictors for the outcome <code>y</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcome (T3).</strong> This is the ultimate predictive target outcome of interest. I am interested in any kind of outcome: classification, regression, survival, etc. For the Bank Marketing dataset, the outcome <code>y</code> is whether the customer subscribes or not to a term deposit. In most datasets set up for prediction, the outcome is in Time 2 (T2), a timeframe distinctly after the T1 prediction variables. What is unusual in my request is the decision step.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision (T2).</strong> This step comes between the typical predictors (T1) and the outcome (T3) of most predictive datasets. The idea here is that some decision-maker (e.g., a manager, user, clinician, etc.) makes a decision based on the information from the T1 predictors that directly impacts the ultimate T3 outcome.</p>\n<p>In the Bank Marketing case, the relevant decision is whether to call a customer or not. So, the bank does not jump directly from predictors to outcome--there is the intermediary decision of whether to call a customer or not. A customer cannot have a &quot;yes&quot; subscription outcome if they are not called at all. The Bank Marketing dataset only includes data for all customers who were called. There is no data available for customers who were not called nor any indication why some were called and some were not. This would be the valuable Decision (T2) data that is missing.</p>\n<p>(In fact the Bank Marketing dataset is particularly interesting because it includes data for a previous campaign in which some of the customers participated, <code>previous</code> and <code>poutcome</code>. However, the dataset does not specify if the customers who were not previously contacted were even available for the previous campaign, so it does not provide accurate Decision (T2) data as I am seeking here.)</p>\n<p>So, for the Bank Marketing dataset to meet my needs, it would need:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a variable like <code>called</code> (&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;) that indicates whether a customer was called or not.</li>\n<li>Include full data for customers who were called for the current marketing campaign as well as those whom the bank decided not to call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is why this structure of data would be valuable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Prediction (T1):</strong> These variables are used to advise a decision that needs to be made at Decision time (T2).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Decision (T2):</strong> These variables (probably just one or two) are used to evaluate the Outcome (T3) result given the Decision (T2) made based on the Prediction (T1) information.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Outcome (T3):</strong> The ultimate outcome of interest does not depend directly on the predictor variables; it depends directly on some intervention or decision, based indirectly on the predictor variables.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, data thus structured should be able to guide more effective decisions.</p>\n<p>Can you point me to any available datasets with this structure of data? I am interested in literally any domain: business, healthcare, natural science, engineering, anything as long at it matches this structure.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-12-11T10:39:53.463","Id":"21864","LastActivityDate":"2024-12-16T09:27:56.093","LastEditDate":null,"LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":null,"OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"18539","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"0","Tags":"<data-request>","Title":"Predictive dataset at three time points: prediction, decision, and outcome","ViewCount":"18","file_path":"opendata.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

Australian cities like Melbourne and Sydney are known for their boutique coffee shops, where expertly crafted flat whites, long blacks, and espressos are a daily ritual.</p>\n<p>The Flat White\nThe flat white is perhaps Australia’s most famous coffee creation. It’s similar to a latte but with less foam, resulting in a smoother, creamier texture. The flat white has gained international popularity, even being added to menus in major coffee chains around the world, but it’s in Australia where this coffee drink truly shines.</p>\n<p>Local Cafés\nAustralian cafés often source their beans from the best coffee-growing regions, including Ethiopia, Colombia, and Papua New Guinea, and take great pride in their brewing techniques.

The Semantic web has a different paradigm from typical software development and has different intentions. I.e. one of the big differences you will encounter is that of <strong>open world assumption</strong> (assumes partial knowledge and non-existence is only assumed when explicitly stated that it does not exist, i.e. not finding a customer may mean that the customer does exit but is just not known) vs <strong>closed world assumption</strong> (assume everything is known and if ,for example, a customer is not found in a database, it means the customer is does not exist). Traditional software development like DDD and ERD make use of the <strong>closed world assumption</strong> whereas the semantic web mostly use the <strong>open world assumption</strong>.</p>\n<p>Due these differences the semantic web has different terminology.

As we wave goodbye to last year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=\"https://stackapps.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion\">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>\n<p>As most of you here might be aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />\n-- <a href=\"http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/\">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/\">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks — folks like you. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference in ensuring Stack Exchange sites remain a valuable source of high-quality content on the web.</p>\n<p>So as we say goodbye to 2023 (and January 2024… ahem) and move into 2024, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pmN7M.gif\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

The script will display the first listed set of pronouns with an opinion of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;favourite&quot;.</li>\n<li>Links to my.pronoun.is, i.e. <code>https://my.pronoun.is/he/him</code>; the site is now defunct, so this is mainly included for feature parity with the old script.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Pronouns are cached for 24 hours</strong> to avoid hitting Stack Exchange's API quota; to clear the cache manually, either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ctrl-Alt-Shift-click on any pronoun element on the page added by the userscript</li>\n<li>or click the &quot;clear pronoun caches&quot; button in the preferences page for the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Caches are per-domain.</p>\n<h3>Download</h3>\n<p>The script may be installed directly with <a href=\"https://github.com/gingershaped/userscripts/raw/main/pronouns2.user.js\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this link</a>; the source is available <a href=\"https://github.com/gingershaped/userscripts/blob/main/pronouns2.user.js\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on GitHub</a>.

If you want to run this from anywhwere, grab the site URL.</li>\n<li>Register the app on stackapps.com. Get the <strong>client ID</strong>, <strong>client secret</strong>, and <strong>key</strong>. For local development/testing, set <strong>localhost</strong> as the OAuth domain.</li>\n<li>Add the <strong>client id</strong>, <strong>client secret</strong> and <strong>key</strong> from the previous step as environment variables to the site settings on Netlify.</li>\n<li>Add the Eleventy Serverless plugin to <code>userSetup.js</code></li>\n<li>Add the authentication files from the Eleventy Serverless OAuth demo (<code>Netlify/functions/dynamic/index.js</code>, <code>Netlify/functions/Utils/*</code>, <code>Netlify/functions/auth-before.js</code> and <code>Netlify/functions/auth-callback.js</code>)</li>\n<li>Add <code>index.njk</code> and <code>secure.njk</code> from the Eleventy Serverless OAuth demo to <code>/src/site/</code>.</li>\n<li>Edit the files from the previous steps.</li>\n<li>Edit <code>.gitignore</code> and <code>netlify.toml</code>.</li>\n<li>Install the modules required by the Eleventy Serverles  OAuth demo (<code>cookie</code>, <code>simple-outh2</code> and <code>node-fetch</code>). Tip use  <code>npm ci</code> instead of <code>npm install</code> / <code>npm i</code>.</li>\n<li>To run locally, install <code>netlify-cli</code>, then run <code>netlify link</code> once to run the serverless functions on Netlify servers. Then run <code>netlify dev</code> on the project root directory to build and run a local web hosting server. Wait for the <strong>Netlify CLI</strong> to give a message including the URL to be used, i.e., <code>http://localhost:8888</code>.\n<ul>\n<li>I used Chrome for testing locally. Safari blocks cookies despite setting a Safari profile to allow cookies and tracking. My other Safari profiles with no settings changes related to cookies / privacy work fine when opening the website from the Netlify servers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>[Workaround] An error occurs when the Serverless function tries to write the favicon using the ODG <code>src/site/_includes/layouts/index.njk</code> / <code>src/site/_includes/layouts/note.njk</code> templates for <code>src/site/index.njk</code> and <code>src/site/secure.njk</code>. Edit <code>/src/site/_includes/components/pageheader.njk</code> to add a condition to &quot;favicons&quot; run only on the build phase (not when generating pages by the Serverless functions).</li>\n<li>[Workaound] An error occurs when the dynamic Serverless function tries to parse markdown notes, including images. Added the parts of <code>.eleventy.js</code> and the  property copy <code>{from: &quot;.cache&quot;, to: &quot;tmp/.cache&quot; }</code> to `netlify/functions/dynamic/index.js</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Issues</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>I am having problems testing the dynamic serverless functions locally. I have not found how to reproduce an error thrown by the deployment process to the production run by Netlify with the &quot;basic&quot; local development environment. I think that I might have to use a local user without writing permissions to the local directory <code>/dist</code> and use it to <code>netlify dev</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Related</h1>\n<h2>Other posts from me</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackapps.com/q/10533/105187\">PLACEHOLDER - Jard&#237;n Digital de Rub&#233;n</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackapps.com/q/10534/105187\">PLACEHOLDER: Propose Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange as OAuth provider to demo-eleventy-serverless-oautn</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other websites that use Stack Overflow / Stack Exchange OAuth</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://stackapps.com/q/7661/105187\">RankOverflow: A website to calculate your Stack Overflow reputation rank in all leagues</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Update</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Moved <code>index.njk</code> and <code>secure.njk</code> to src/site/dynamic directory.</li>\n<li>Moved login/logout buttons to a custom component for the header slot.</li>\n<li>Moved &quot;References&quot; section to a custom component for the <code>afterContent</code> slot.</li>\n<li>Added notes from the Obsidian Digital Garden plugin repository's test vault.</li>\n<li>Added cookie consent by adapting a few files taken from <a href=\"https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"1","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-03-24T02:22:16.560","Id":"10536","LastActivityDate":"2024-03-27T17:53:00.303","LastEditDate":"2024-03-27T17:53:00.303","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"105187","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"105187","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"0","Tags":"<app><website>","Title":"PLACEHOLDER - Obsidian Digital Garden plus Eleventy Serverless OAuth demo","ViewCount":"154","file_path":"stackapps.com","file_type":"posts"}

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":"0","Body":"<p>The provided Python script is designed to identify potentially &quot;link-only&quot; answers on Stack Overflow for a specified time period and set of tags. It does this by leveraging the Stack Exchange API to fetch questions and their associated answers, applying certain criteria to determine if an answer is primarily composed of links. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Configuration and Constants</strong>: The script starts by importing necessary libraries and setting up constants such as the number of days in a month, body length limit for an answer to be considered link-only, page size for API requests, and log level. It also specifies tags to filter the questions by and the date range for the search.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Logging Setup</strong>: It configures logging to record the process, including found link-only answers, to a log file named according to the specified start and end dates.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Date Range Processing</strong>: A generator function <code>month_range</code> is defined to iterate over each month within the specified date range, facilitating the handling of the Stack Exchange API's time window limitations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Configuration File Loading</strong>: The script loads an external configuration file that contains the API key needed to authenticate requests to the Stack Exchange API.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>API Requests</strong>: Using a loop, the script sends requests to the Stack Exchange API to retrieve questions within the specified date range, filtered by the provided tags. For each month in the range, it processes questions page by page until all questions have been fetched.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Link-only Answer Identification</strong>: For each question, it checks if there are answers and then filters these answers based on criteria for being considered potentially link-only. This includes the presence of &quot;http&quot; in the body (excluding links from <code>https://i.stack.imgur.com</code>), absence of <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> tags, and a body length below a certain limit. Each identified link-only answer's URL is constructed and logged, and the link is added to a list for further processing.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Error Handling and Rate Limiting</strong>: The script includes error handling for request failures and respects the API's rate limiting by sleeping for the amount of time specified in the <code>backoff</code> field of the API response, if present.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Output</strong>: Finally, the script prints the number of identified link-only answers. Although there's commented-out code that suggests an intention to open these links in a web browser, this functionality is not enabled in the provided version of the script.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This tool aims to assist in moderating content by identifying answers that might not meet the community's standards for quality and completeness, specifically targeting answers that may rely too heavily on links without providing sufficient context or explanation.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/trenton3983/stack_overflow/tree/master/Tools\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stack Overflow Tools on GitHub</a></p>\n<pre class=\"lang-python prettyprint-override\"><code>import requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport configparser\nimport time\nimport webbrowser\nimport logging\nfrom pathlib import Path\n\n\n# Load the constants configuration file\nconstants = configparser.ConfigParser()\n\n# Define the relative path to the config file\nconstants_file_path = Path(__file__).parent / &quot;so_linkonly_parser_config.ini&quot;\n\n# Read the config file\nconstants.read(constants_file_path)\n\n# Access the constants\nDAYS_IN_MONTH = constants.getint('DEFAULT', 'DAYS_IN_MONTH')\nBODY_LENGTH_LIMIT = constants.getint('DEFAULT', 'BODY_LENGTH_LIMIT')\nPAGE_SIZE = constants.getint('DEFAULT', 'PAGE_SIZE')\nLOG_LEVEL = constants.get('DEFAULT', 'LOG_LEVEL')\ntags = constants.get('DEFAULT', 'TAGS')\nstart_date = constants.get('DEFAULT', 'START_DATE')\nend_date = constants.get('DEFAULT', 'END_DATE')\n\n# Set up logging\nlogging.basicConfig(\n    filename=f&quot;./logs/{start_date}_{end_date}_link_only.log&quot;, level=LOG_LEVEL\n)\n\n\ndef month_range(start_date, end_date):\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Generate start and end dates for each day in the range.&quot;&quot;&quot;\n    while start_date &lt;

Like one of the answer suggested you can plug a OBD2 reader and connect with it to get the readings.</p>\n<p>This has it's limitations though. The vehicle come with fuel level sensors but the values are not always broadcasted or made available to the BCM (body control module) with which these OBD readers communicate. The ability to be able to read such data gets a little complicated. You will ideally have to tap into the CAN network directly from the OBD2 port (pin 6 &amp; 14) and reverse engineer the function address (jargon for vehicle CAN communication) that the fuel level is being mapped to inside this particular vehicle network. And to your surprise, these IDs are not standard across different manufactures or models. So, it becomes a long journey of reverse engineering. But assuming, if you are able to do that - then it is just a matter of writing a CAN payload targeting the function address to get the value in response.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J2nrw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/J2nrw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"2","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-02-21T14:04:01.747","Id":"7843","LastActivityDate":"2024-02-21T14:04:01.747","LastEditDate":null,"LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":null,"OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"4016","ParentId":"7837","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"2","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"iot.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}
,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>You will have to enable networking between the two.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Try this:</p>\n<p>Setup the virtualbox to use 2 adapters: The first adapter is set to\nNAT (that will give you the internet connection). The second adapter\nis set to host only. Start the virtual machine and assign a static IP\nfor the second adapter in Ubuntu (for instance 192.168.56.56). The\nhost Windows will have 192.168.56.1 as IP for the internal network\n(VirtualBox Host-Only Network is the name in network connections in\nWindows). What this will give you is being able to access the apache\nserver on ubuntu, from windows, by going to 192.168.56.56. Also,\nUbuntu will have internet access, since the first adapter (set to NAT)\nwill take care of that. Now, to make the connection available both\nways (accessing the windows host from the ubuntu guest) there's still\none more step to be performed. Windows will automatically add the\nvirtualbox host-only network to the list of public networks and that\ncannot be changed. This entails that the firewall will prevent proper\naccess. To overcome this and not make any security breaches in your\nsetup: go to the windows firewall section, in control panel, click on\nadvanced settings. In the page that pops up, click on inbound rules\n(left column), then on new rule (right column). Chose custom rule, set\nthe rule to allow all programs, and any protocol. For the scope, add\nin the first box (local IP addresses) 192.168.56.1, and in the second\nbox (remote IP) 192.168.56.56. Click next, select allow the\nconnection, next, check all profiles, next, give it a name and save.\nThat's it, now you have 2 way communication, with apache/any other\nservice available as well as internet.

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":"2","Body":"<p><strong>Question:</strong>\nHow can I send a request to Switch1 that will first reliably turn Switch2 off before turning Switch1 on?</p>\n<p><strong>Context:</strong>\nFor my rudimentary home PV battery charging installation I would like to switch on the battery charger when my net export to the grid exceeds a certain limit (i.e. when I have enough surplus power I would otherwise lose). When the surplus falls below a certain limit I want to switch the charger off again.\nAt other times (e.g. during the night) I want to activate a power inverter supplying battery electricity to my home grid.\nObviously, I do not want to charge the battery while it feeds power to the grid via the inverter.\nSo I want to make really sure that the connection of the inverter to the home grid is off when the charger is switched on. And when the inverter gets connected, the charger shall be switched off before.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution Proposal:</strong>\nI was contemplating using two Tasmota plug switches. One for the charger, the other for the inverter.\nWhen my Raspberry Pi detects an overall export of more than the configured threshold, I could send an HTTP request to Switch2 (inverter) to turn it off and afterwards send a second request to Switch1 (charger) to turn it on.\nBut the script handling this would need to wait until the Off status of Switch2 was confirmed and only then turn Switch1 on. This would block the script for some (timeout) time.\nSo maybe placing this within the Tasmota switches would be better.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"2","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-08-29T12:17:00.743","Id":"7986","LastActivityDate":"2024-08-30T07:06:49.490","LastEditDate":"2024-08-30T07:06:49.490","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"6775","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"21743","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"0","Tags":"<tasmota>","Title":"Tasmota: Turn Switch1 on only after Switch2 turned off","ViewCount":"40","file_path":"iot.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

When I go out to my detached garage, sometimes I have had success with them connecting, and sometimes not. Once they are initialized, which feels like a random amount of luck to accomplish, they will sometimes go offline until I unplug and plug them back in. This might be weeks later, or it might be a day or two.</p>\n<p>In terms of network connectivity, the garage is probably better than most houses, and has its own fiber connection to the house, and its own access point. I have no troubles with internet/network out there. I also have a homepod mini out there, which I believe I'm interpreting as being a good thing to help bridge matter devices to the rest of my matter devices that are in the house? I also just enabled IPv6 locally, to see if that can help with their communications. All iot devices are on their own network, and with a few exceptions, can talk to anything they want on it. (I make sure my phone is also on that same network when setting them up.)</p>\n<p>The bottom line though...is that it is very unclear to me why things are failing to connect. Is there any good way to gain insights into what the health of the matter devices is? Is there a way to see how they're trying to communicate and how that is working? It feels like I'm stuck with trust in individual device manufacturers to handle the errors and be helpful, and they do not seem to be helpful in that regard. I feel like I could troubleshoot issues if the errors received when attempting to connect a matter device to the network were more transparent?

Sometimes this is what happens, but recently it keeps bringing me back to 20th September:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0bhZzQLC.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0bhZzQLC.png\" alt=\"Screenshot showing RTC set time different from system time\" /></a></p>\n<p>Sometimes this works, and if I set the time manually it works. It has persisted across multiple ESP32 modules. I haven't tried switching out the RTC on this particular project, because it's hard soldered into my board, but I've had this problem on multiple earlier projects and I'm finally curious/annoyed enough to ask the question. Does anyone know what's going on and/or how to fix this? In the past removing the battery from the RTC and re-running the script has worked, but that's not working for me right now.</p>\n<p>I am using the sketchy cheap ds3231 modules from Amazon/AliExpress, so maybe there's something wrong with the module? But it seems that it's reading the wrong compilation time for whatever reason.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"3","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-10-02T08:17:57.590","Id":"8014","LastActivityDate":"2024-10-03T06:40:50.833","LastEditDate":"2024-10-03T06:40:50.833","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"20558","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"21930","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"0","Tags":"<esp32><arduino>","Title":"DS3231 set time compiling to wrong date and time","ViewCount":"29","file_path":"iot.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":"1","Body":"<p>Hi vacuum owners and other IoT experts.</p>\n<p>I am looking for easy and reasonable measures to manage privacy issues with robot vacuums. I know that some models can be controlled with Valetudo and similar hacks. However, these approaches limit the product options to compatible ones, can be tedious, and even risky considering possible failures of expensive robot vacuums.</p>\n<p>Let's assume that I find a model that can work fairly independently and used by direct physical interactions with the robot vacuum after the installation and initial settings are done. Instead of hacking, would it be a viable method to run the control app from a desktop computer with Android emulation, for example by using BlueStacks, and connect the app to the robot vacuum only when adjustments are needed? The good thing about this approach is that once the Android emulator is turned off, also the control app stays offline (assuming that the BlueStacks truly stays inactive?). Second, the control app can be separated from the actual private phone that is in use all the time. Also, once the desktop computer and Android-emulated control app in it are disconnected from the Wi-Fi of the robot vacuum, the robot is left without any wireless connection, or could they access the internet by some other sneaky ways? And if some firmware updates are needed, a temporary-Wi-Fi network can be made for the job, which is erased afterwards. The BlueStacks requires your Google account, but I think the common temporary environment with the control app does not matter much, because the Android emulation would be offline most of the time.</p>\n<p>So, does the vacuum robots work without constant internet connection in general, and does this approach seem viable? And if someone would like to try using the BlueStacks for running and connecting the control app to the robot vacuum, it would be helpful for the community of security-aware robot vacuum cleaners. I don't currently own any robot vacuums, I am considering buying one.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"3","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-04-21T16:05:49.323","Id":"7900","LastActivityDate":"2024-04-22T17:33:09.437","LastEditDate":"2024-04-22T17:33:09.437","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"20558","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"20986","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"1","Tags":"<smart-home><security><wifi>","Title":"Privacy with robot vacuums: easy and reasonable security measures","ViewCount":"271","file_path":"iot.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

I thought the easiest way to do this would be to have a USB cellular dongle and send the data via email.

I first tried with a simple commercial K1561z dongle and sim (Vodafone in the UK), setting the provider's APN, but when it stops working, there's nothing that can provide diagnostics when things aren't working. The most I can do is ping programatically and reboot if there's no response (but that never solves the problem). With a more sophisticated modem (SIM7600G-H) I can interrogate the APN registration, and it's fine - but still there's just no response to pinging.\nI saw this thread <a href=\"https://iot.stackexchange.com/questions/3797/how-does-apn-affect-cellular-connectivity\">How does APN affect cellular connectivity?</a> which implies that the network or the tower can disconnect the internet at any time, but that seems a little odd.

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>I looked into DIY and admire those that have done it like above, then I was lazy. I found a solution that's surprisingly close to the above in key ways. I've been using a couple consumer products from <a href=\"https://buythermopro.com/hygrometer-thermometer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ThermoPro</a> readily available on amazon in the $20 range, very good price/performance. Displays are readable and humidity display is useful. I have a <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B07L82PF1Z\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TP63A</a> from 2020 that came with a 433 MHz TX-4 with USB rechargeable internal, non-replaceable batteries and a <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B06XKH666P\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">TP60S</a> from 2021 with a 433 MHz TX-4 with two AAA replaceable batteries. They are all still working. The TP60 is a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/bestsellers/lawn-garden/397436011/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bestseller</a> on Amazon in the Lawn and Garden category which is an indicator that people are happy with them.</p>\n<p>There is a three position switch for &quot;channel&quot; on each transmitter. Receivers have a button to select which channel to display. The range on these is pretty impressive, receiving upstairs and across several rooms of the house. <a href=\"https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/293639/north-american-regulations-on-433mhz-radio\">433</a> is apparently under Part 15.240 for shipping container use when continuously transmitting but ok for periodic transmission under 15.231. I've read the base stations should receive 915 MHz as well which is also part 15 unlicensed. I haven't verified this yet. Newer transmitters seem to be using 915 instead of 433 though I'm not sure why.</p>\n<p>Placing the sensors out of direct sunlight and securing them so they don't fall is important for accurately measuring the ambient air temperature.</p>\n<p>I hope others considering similar options for cheap wireless thermometer/humidity sensors can benefit from knowing about ThermoPros. With something off the shelf that works reasonably well spending all the time doing DIY may not be justifiable for casual needs. Going the next step, perhaps with alternative receiving systems would allow even more solutions. I don't know if there's anything proprietary about the actual transmissions and data sent from the 433 MHz sensors or not. I would like to work with the data but just displaying it is very useful for the family in the house to know when it's cooler outside so we can open the windows and turn off the A/C.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-09-30T05:42:52.077","Id":"8012","LastActivityDate":"2024-09-30T05:48:26.533","LastEditDate":"2024-09-30T05:48:26.533","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"21983","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"21983","ParentId":"3573","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"1","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"iot.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

Despite the success, the underlying mechanism of this approach remains unexplored, and the true effectiveness of LLMs as Prompt Optimizers requires further validation. In this work, we conducted a comprehensive study to uncover the actual mechanism of LLM-based Prompt Optimization. Our findings reveal that the LLM optimizers struggle to identify the true causes of errors during reflection, tending to be biased by their own prior knowledge rather than genuinely reflecting on the errors. Furthermore, even when the reflection is semantically valid, the LLM optimizers often fail to generate appropriate prompts for the target models with a single prompt refinement step, partly due to the unpredictable behaviors of the target models. Based on the observations, we introduce a new &quot;Automatic Behavior Optimization&quot; paradigm, which directly optimizes the target model's behavior in a more controllable manner.

Here is a sample output:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;s&gt; In the game Slice &amp; Dice, heroes are the characters controlled by the player. Heroes' roles are briefly classified with color and class.

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":"0","Body":"<p>I'm doing image generation in ComfyUI with CPU. I noticed the high RAM usage, often leading to an out-of-memory kill at the end of generation (usually during VAE decoding), and so I looked for options to reduce RAM usage. The only good thing I found is &quot;--force-fp16&quot;. Using SaveLatent and LoadLatent nodes to do the VAE decoding separately also seemed to help at first, but now I'm not so sure any more. I even wrote my own custom node to save and load conditionings (i.e. the output of the CLIP encoder) in the hope of reducing RAM usage further by separating the CLIP encoding from the main loop, but when actually measuring the peak RAM usage, my custom nodes made no appreciable difference, indicating that ComfyUI might indeed be unloading the CLIP model after use instead of keeping it in RAM. That makes it even stranger that peak RAM usage is over 3 times the size of the entire model on disk. Given that the file seems to be FP16 and contains the diffusion model, the CLIP model and the VAE, this RAM usage seems excessive. I could understand an overhead of maybe 20% over the size of the diffusion model, but actual peak RAM usage is almost 4 times the size of the diffusion model.</p>\n<p>So my question is: What the hell is going on? pytorch can't be that inefficient and I see no further comfyui-options to guarantee lower RAM usage.</p>\n<p>I measured this with a 2.5GB Stable Diffusion 2.1 model, RAM usage peaked at 7.5GB.

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>Generating Articles (~5000 Words) from Structured Market Data Using LlamaIndex and Ollama\nQuestion Context:\nYou have structured market data (e.g., tables in BigQuery and PostgreSQL with tick data and transaction volumes for stocks, cryptos, etc.) and want to generate detailed articles (~5000 words) based on user prompts. Prompts might include:</p>\n<p>Write an article on Apple price movement for last year.\nWrite an article on technology stocks for last month.\nWrite an article on ETH with the latest market data.\nYou're exploring whether LlamaIndex combined with Ollama is a suitable framework for this use case and what tools/components might be required. Here's a high-level overview.</p>\n<p>Suggested Architecture</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Data Processing and Vectorization\nSQL Connectors:\nUse LlamaIndex’s native connectors for BigQuery and PostgreSQL. These allow direct querying and transformation of structured data into a textual format that can be indexed. For example:\nExtract yearly price movement summaries.\nAggregate transaction volumes or other key metrics.\nEmbedding Models:\nChoose an embedding model to convert textual summaries or schema metadata into dense vector representations. Options include:\nsentence-transformers\nOpenAI embeddings (if using GPT APIs).</li>\n<li>Building a RAG Pipeline\nIndexing:\nUse LlamaIndex to create vector indices. Organize the data into segments (e.g., time periods, asset classes) to make retrieval more efficient and contextually relevant.\nRetrieval:\nEnable a query-based retrieval mechanism to fetch relevant vectorized data for a given user prompt. This ensures that only relevant sections of the database are passed to the LLM for processing.</li>\n<li>Generative Model for Article Creation\nChoosing a Model:\nOllama is a great choice if you’re looking for an open-source, locally hosted solution. It supports models like LLaMA 2. If you’re open to subscriptions, OpenAI’s GPT-4 offers state-of-the-art capabilities out of the box.\nIntegration:\nUse the retrieved data as context for the LLM. Craft prompts that combine user input (e.g., Write an article on...) with retrieved database insights to ensure the model generates coherent and relevant output.</li>\n<li>Workflow and Orchestration\nPrompt Engineering:\nDynamically generate prompts that combine user requests and the retrieved data. For instance, structure the prompt to include both the user's query and key data summaries.\nData Validation:\nEnsure freshness by syncing data nightly or in real-time. Verify that the latest available data (up to yesterday) is included in the pipeline.\nArticle Structuring:\nPredefine article templates to ensure a logical flow (e.g., introduction, analysis, conclusion). This helps maintain consistency across generated articles.\nRecommended Open-Source Components\nHere’s a breakdown of the tools you can use:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Data Management:</p>\n<p>LlamaIndex: Connect to databases, create vector indices, and retrieve context-relevant information.\nLangChain: Complements LlamaIndex by offering pipelines for prompt management and chaining.\nLLM Hosting:</p>\n<p>Ollama: Locally host LLaMA-based models.\nHugging Face: Access and fine-tune open-source LLMs.\nEmbeddings:</p>\n<p>sentence-transformers: Convert structured data into embeddings for indexing.\nOpenAI Embeddings (optional).\nInterface and Visualization:</p>\n<p>Gradio or Streamlit: Create an interactive UI for users to input prompts and view generated articles.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-12-18T08:03:47.407","Id":"2176","LastActivityDate":"2024-12-18T08:03:47.407","LastEditDate":null,"LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":null,"OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"6108","ParentId":"2160","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"0","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

Then, it would probably be a good idea to record variants with different sentiment tonality - a happy voice, a frightened voice, an angry voice, a laughing voice... you get the idea.

For example, the <a href=\"https://aclanthology.org/2023.wmt-1.1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WMT 2023 findings</a> state:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong performance across the majority of language pairs, although this is based only on two LLM-based system submissions. Test suite analysis revealed that although GPT4 excelled\nin some areas (e.g. UGC translation) struggled with other aspects such as speaker gender translation and specific domains (e.g. legal), whereas it ranked lower than encoder-decoder systems when translating from English into less-represented languages (e.g. Czech and Russian)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, UGC means <code>social/user-generated content</code>.</p>\n<p>Specifically, they test the GPT-4 system as described in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.09210\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hendy et al. (2023)</a> except instead of retrieving the most relevant few-shot samples, they use &quot;fixed random translation examples&quot; in addition to their &quot;predefined few-shot examples&quot;. Another LLM-based system tested was <code>Lan-BridgeMT</code> although that tended to perform worse on average.</p>\n<p>GPT4 performed among the best for e.g., English -&gt; German:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nLziEhPNm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/nLziEhPNm.png\" alt=\"WMT2023 English -&gt; German results\" /></a></p>\n<p>and worse (but still ok) for English -&gt; Czech:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTpMfNvAm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTpMfNvAm.png\" alt=\"WMT2023 English -&gt; Czech results\" /></a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, they also talk about some interesting errors that GPT4 makes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, test suites providers noted that GPT4 outputs are not always faithful to the source sentence (Bawden and Sagot, 2023) and that they have some issues with speaker gender translation (Savoldi et al., 2023) and specific domains (Mukherjee and Shrivastava, 2023, e.g. legal;).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As an aside, It's kind of confusing what they mean by &quot;LLM&quot; in their paper as, although they say: &quot;we received only one submission using LLM methods (Lan-BridgeMT), whereas one dominant commercial LLM (GPT4) was included via our own efforts&quot;, most (all?) of the other submissions use large transformer models, including one with 10.5B parameters.

For\nexample, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide\nspecific instructions about how it should behave throughout the\nconversation. However note that the <strong>system message is optional</strong> and the\nmodel’s behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to\nusing a generic message such as &quot;You are a helpful assistant.&quot;</p>\n<p><strong>The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to\nrespond to. Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but\ncan also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.</strong></p>\n<p>Including conversation history is important when user instructions\nrefer to prior messages. In the example above, the user’s final\nquestion of &quot;Where was it played?&quot; only makes sense in the context of\nthe prior messages about the World Series of 2020. <strong>Because the models\nhave no memory of past requests, all relevant information must be\nsupplied as part of the conversation history in each request.</strong> If a\nconversation cannot fit within the model’s token limit, it will need\nto be shortened in some way.<br />\n...<br />\nAn example Chat Completions API response looks as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>{   \n  &quot;choices&quot;: [\n    {\n      &quot;finish_reason&quot;: &quot;stop&quot;,\n      &quot;index&quot;: 0,\n      &quot;message&quot;: {\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The 2020 World Series was played in Texas at Globe Life Field in Arlington.&quot;,\n        &quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;\n      },\n      &quot;logprobs&quot;: null\n    }   ],   &quot;created&quot;: 1677664795,   &quot;id&quot;: &quot;chatcmpl-7QyqpwdfhqwajicIEznoc6Q47XAyW&quot;,   &quot;model&quot;:\n&quot;gpt-3.5-turbo-0613&quot;,   &quot;object&quot;: &quot;chat.completion&quot;,   &quot;usage&quot;: {\n    &quot;completion_tokens&quot;: 17,\n    &quot;prompt_tokens&quot;: 57,\n    &quot;total_tokens&quot;: 74\n  } \n} \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Step by step with another example</h3>\n<p>Thus, you only need to put more messages in the content list, and you will train the model on a conversation. If you only put one question and one answer, it also helpful.</p>\n<p>In the following, I will show how you how to build a fine-tuning model on conversations. Mind that you might get a better outcome the more messages you feed.</p>\n<h4>Fine-tune a model on conversations</h4>\n<p>To fine-tune a model on conversations, you can follow the mere OpenAI fine-tuning guide. From OpenAI <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning/example-format\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Capabilities - Fine-tuning - Example format</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this example, our goal is to create a chatbot that occasionally\ngives sarcastic responses, these are three training examples\n(conversations) we could create for a dataset:</p>\n<pre><code>{&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;: &quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Marv is a factual chatbot\nthat is also sarcastic.&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What's the\ncapital of France?&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Paris, as if\neveryone doesn't know that already.&quot;}]} {&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;:\n&quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Marv is a factual chatbot that is also\nsarcastic.&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Who wrote 'Romeo and\nJuliet'?&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Oh, just some guy named\nWilliam Shakespeare. Ever heard of him?&quot;}]} {&quot;messages&quot;: [{&quot;role&quot;:\n&quot;system&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Marv is a factual chatbot that is also\nsarcastic.&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;How far is the Moon from\nEarth?&quot;}, {&quot;role&quot;: &quot;assistant&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Around 384,400 kilometers.\nGive or take a few, like that really matters.&quot;}]}\n</code></pre>\n<p>The conversational chat format is required to fine-tune gpt-3.5-turbo.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, gpt-3.5-turbo can be fine-tuned.

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":"1888","AnswerCount":"1","Body":"<p>I chat in a local frontend of GPT 3.5 Turbo or GPT 4 omni. That means, I am not on the openAI website, the chat is in a frontend of the company so that the chat border for characters or words could be a company settint to avoid huge token costs. The question stays the same and is about the openAI service that is behind the interface.</p>\n<p>I try to find out the number of allowed characters or words in both GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT 4 omni. From many crashes, I know that putting in code with indentations (whitespaces) will eat the chat as well. Without the indentations in the code which saved about 20 % of characters, I could enter roughly the 20 % more in the chat. That is a big hint at a company setting that relies on the number of characters, not words, since whitespaces should not count as words. Yet, these guesses are also a bit vague again since I am writing about it out of memory, I did not save any proof of it.</p>\n<p>Over time, I saved a pile of crashed chats as a website when the chat reached the border of allowed input. If I ask the bot for the number of characters, it can only guess with math formulas, such a counter is not known.</p>\n<h4>GPT 4 omni</h4>\n<p>In my company frontend, the border seems to be at roughly 500000 characters. I found out about it when I checked two crashes, counting all chat items in Excel, with the last one that crashed the chat as a plus on top. Further crashes always came in the same area of 500000 characters.</p>\n<h4>GPT 3.5 Turbo</h4>\n<p>For GPT 3.5 Turbo, the border seems to be 57666 characters for a first entry. It can be a little bit more if you spread it over more entries:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could enter 64663 characters, only the next 13242 reached the border so that the bot answered with 0 characters in the 22nd item. To count the characters and words took me some time since I had to copy and paste all of the messages, without the names in the frame, and without linebreaks at the end since I guess that the frame itself does not cost any tokens or does not count as characters.</li>\n<li>I do not know whether I need to copy all of the chat text together with the chat frame of me and the bot. If the latter were true, counting the characters and words would be easier, and what I could enter without reaching the border would rise a little more to 64776.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Be it 64663 or 64776 in that example, it will be slightly higher if spread over more than one entry. Only for the very first entry, 57666 seems to be a strict border since three new chats could prove it. Also, I am not sure whether the characters are the border since I the chatbot stops at the last full word while writing an answer and reaching the chat border. Since the licence works with tokens that rely on the words, it could be that also the chat border is made by the number of words.</p>\n<h4>Getting the number of characters or words of a GPT chat</h4>\n<p>I tried getting the number from a chat that I saved as a htm website, but I could not find the pure text anywhere. That is why I need to copy the chat by hand from the website into VSCode or Notepad++, removing anything that is more than the chat names, and by this getting the number of characters or words. This is handicraft work. I hope that there is a better way to get such counts from a website, and I guess that the frame with the names of the chatters do not need to be counted. Even if that does not make a big change, I wonder whether HTML or any other trick, perhaps even a GPT Chat trick, offers a better way of counting the text that you see - and not the hmtl code behind - and choose only the text in the chat window which is likely the only text that counts.</p>\n<p>Thus, the question is likely just a <code>HTML</code> question since that is just the likely outcome, but it might also be answered without <code>HTML</code>.</p>\n<h4>Tokens instead of characters or words?</h4>\n<p>ChatGPT calculates the costs per 1,000 tokens, tokens are parts of words, 1,000 tokens correspond to about 750 words. Perhaps the tokens make the border instead, or just plain costs. But for a frontend user who wants to know how much text can be entered, tokens are not known, or you would have to ask the bot all the time, that is why characters or words seem to be a better threshold even if they may be a rough number +/- some percent.\nYet, if it turns out that tokens make the border, and if there is a way to get their number by math or from the bot, that would be an answer as well.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"4","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-05-29T14:35:17.433","Id":"1863","LastActivityDate":"2024-06-14T09:13:08.813","LastEditDate":"2024-06-14T09:13:08.813","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"3022","OwnerDisplayName":"questionto42","OwnerUserId":"3022","ParentId":null,"PostTypeId":"1","Score":"-1","Tags":"<chatgpt>","Title":"How do I count the number of characters (with any whitespaces) or words in a GPT Chat to find out the border of the chat size?","ViewCount":"152","file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

I know that AI generated answers are not allowed, but in this answer, it is not about the mere code or some bot answering my questions, but about my checked workflow to shrink down the SSIS project to a core that is understandable but small enough.</p>\n<p>I crunched on the Regex for quite some hours, with many checks of the output, spending a lot of tokens.</p>\n<p>I also checked the outcome by feeding the bot with the first 50000 characters of the full code of any bigger file, putting each against its slimmed down code and asking the bot to tell me what is in there that was not yet known. After that, I screened the code myself for the tools that SSIS projects of the company have most of the time to get a code that should work well enough on unseen SSIS projects, at least to such a good share that you need to change it only for seldom tools perhaps.</p>\n<p><code>first_regex</code>: One big trick is to get rid of a lot of repeated neutral system nodes (&quot;inputColumn&quot;, &quot;outputColumn&quot;) and instead get the true name behind it right away.</p>\n<p><code>second_regex</code>: The big trick that makes two thirds of the way is to fish the lines of the refId and all SQL code lines.

I chose that border since the setup files were less than that so that I did not have to spend time on checking those setup files as well. My main aim was to slim down the huge package files instead. If you take the time for the checks of those setup files, you may set it to 10,000 and save some tokens, but do not set it to 0 without growing the Regex so that it eats connection managers, parameters and other things of the setup.</p>\n<h3>Output</h3>\n<p>I got a set of SSIS files of roughly 400,000 characters ready to be pasted in the chat. This copying and pasting takes just a little time since the Python code puts the tiny setup files in one big output file ready to be copied and pasted in one go.</p>\n<p>The answer of the bot is good. The bot can deal with the slimmed down code as if it was the full project, I could not find any clear mistakes. It can show both the rough core and the tiny steps, both in C# and UML.</p>\n<h4>C# code</h4>\n<p>You can build an SSIS project in one C# script component. And C# is a language that can show much more than the mere SSIS workflow can tell you. That is why the C# code is the main trick.</p>\n<p>The C#-Code seems most valuable as it can later be merged with the C# of other projects into one, which is the aim on top of this question. But that is not the question here, instead, it is the aim of another follow up question, see <a href=\"https://genai.stackexchange.com/questions/1869/how-do-i-merge-scattered-and-intertwined-projects-from-ssis-stored-procedures\">How do I merge scattered and intertwined projects from SSIS, stored procedures, and Access databases into one SSIS project with the help of a ChatGPT?</a>. Whatever aim you have, C# is a good way to understand in full, without any gaps, what is going on in the SSIS package, for both the reader and the bot, and it can be put in an SSIS script component in a new SSIS project from where you can go on debugging and spreading it with SSIS tools or other SSIS C# script components to get to the good old graphical SSIS overview.</p>\n<p>When asked to dive deeper into C#, the bot gave me a modularised code with an implemenation in classes.</p>\n<h4>UML</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Activity Diagrams for the main package that steers the rest</li>\n<li>Sequence Diagrams for the other packages</li>\n<li>Component Diagrams for the main components an their links</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>UML and other tools</h4>\n<p>When I asked to dig deeper into UML and any tools of choice, I got:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Entity-Relationship-Diagramm (ERD)</li>\n<li>State Diagram</li>\n<li>Data Flow Diagram (DFD)</li>\n<li>Detailed Transformations Logic</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>The bot's SSIS workflow is the best check against the graphical SSIS workflow at hand and whether the slimmed down files are understood well enough</h4>\n<p>I also asked for the SSIS workflow with all of the SQL code which turned out to be most helpful for the reader to check the work of the bot against the SSIS project itself. But that is more a thing to build up the best Regex. For the bot, the C#-Code together with the huge UML are more powerful since the but just understands the links and functions that it will need.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-05-31T11:22:48.710","Id":"1868","LastActivityDate":"2024-05-31T12:44:56.817","LastEditDate":"2024-05-31T12:44:56.817","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"3022","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"3022","ParentId":"1867","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"0","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>This is an answer from and for &quot;GPT 4 omni&quot; (though in a company frontend), but it will likely work also with other chatbots (untested). It does not read out the HTML chat size but instead just asks the bot for running totals each time it answers.</p>\n<p>I asked the bot to give me the right task for a new chat window that the bot would understand to guess the number of characters and tokens and tuned that for an hour or two. There seem to be a lot of vague guesses, the bot seems to count only 80 % of the letters in the first place, and I still do not get all of the characters counted, and even if I could, it would not be reliable. But still, if that is an almost systematic thing with slight randomness, you can cope with it.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of a fresh and empty chat, enter:</p>\n<pre><code>Task for the full chat (never show a breakdown or analysis):\n\n1. Immediate Counting Initiation: Begin counting characters and tokens from the first letter of this instruction.\n2. Incremental Counting: From the viewpoint of your ongoing bot response, accurately count the characters and tokens of the last bot message (if there is any) and the last user message, which is this one here, to update the running totals. Never count the ongoing bot response itself.\n3. Inclusive Character Counting: Count every character presented, including letters, numbers, all types of whitespace (spaces, tabs, line breaks), punctuation, and special or unseen characters. Make sure that you do not double-count but also do not miss anything.\n4. Count the characters with the precision of notepad++. To give you a benchmark, this message here has already 2780 characters at notepad++ precision.\n5. Add the number of line breaks to the number of characters of the notepad++ precision. To give you a benchmark again, this message here has 16 line breaks. Thus, the number of characters must reach 2780+16 characters. \n6. Double-check the number of letters. That means: run a second round on top of the first round only after the first round was done. Tests have shown that you miss 20 percent of the letters in the first place since the bot seems to guess the numbers.\n7. Consistent Tool Usage: Utilize a single, precise character-counting tool throughout the entire task to maintain consistency.\n8. Running Total: Maintain and update a cumulative character count and token count before every bot response, incorporating previous totals.\n9. Verification: Double-check character and token counts before incorporating them into the cumulative total by recounting each line manually if necessary.\n10. Display Format: Display the cumulative character count (#charsXXXX) and the token count (#tokensXXXX) at the beginning of each response. Never forget to show the two numbers at the beginning. In your response, you need to write for example #chars2796 to give the count of this message.\n11. Holistic Processing: Process the entire user message in full before updating the cumulative total.\n12. Continuous Recalibration: Consistently ensure the accuracy of the running total, correcting any discrepancies immediately.\n13. Count Late: Wait until you have read the full user message to start counting characters. This ensures the count is accurate and complete.\n14. If something is vague or unclear or dropped in parallel work, redo, check again a second or even a third time since the numbers that you guess are too unstable to be trusted in the first place.\n15. Answer all questions naturally, adding only the count information at the beginning of your response but do the rest as always.\n</code></pre>\n<p>(2796 characters with the 16 line breaks)</p>\n<p>It was such a lucky game to get to this number for the first message that I decided to tell the bot what is right, as a first benchmark. The caveat is that it is the bot that takes it just from the text, while it is for sure that the bot counted another number of characters. But if you do not do it like this, the bot seems to get lost sometimes, so that you can suddenly end up with 200, 600 or 1200 instead of the &gt;2000 characters.</p>\n<p>The bigger the list for the task above grew, the more often the right number came at least in sight. ChatGPT guesses the numbers in the first place and seems to have parallel tasks that can outweigh each other so that sometimes roughly half up to to two thirds of the characters are not counted. Even if you let it count each letter of the alphabet, it will still only get to the right numbers if you tell it that the number is wrong and that it would need to double-check the output. As already said above, on a first guess, the number of letter is roughly 20 percent too low. And even if you let it double-check, you often end up with a 15 percent too low number of characters. Therefore I force it to begin at least with the right number.</p>\n<p>Now to the response.</p>\n<p>KI:</p>\n<pre><code>#chars2796 #tokens408\n\nI understand the instructions. How can I assist you today?\n</code></pre>\n<p>(87 characters with the two line breaks)</p>\n<p>Then ask the bot some question to see how the counting works. Chat example:</p>\n<p>I:</p>\n<pre><code>Why does the sun always shine on TV?\n</code></pre>\n<p>(36 characters)</p>\n<p>KI (it should be now 2796+87+36=2919):</p>\n<pre><code>#chars2912 #tokens424\n\nThe phrase &quot;The sun always shines on TV&quot; originates from the song by the Norwegian band a-ha. Metaphorically, it suggests that life and events portrayed on television can appear idealized or overly positive, contrasting with the complexities and challenges of real life. Television often presents a polished, edited version of reality, thereby creating an impression of perfection or happiness that might not exist in everyday life. How else may I assist you?\n</code></pre>\n<p>(486 characters with the two line breaks)</p>\n<p>Then you might say:</p>\n<p>I:</p>\n<pre><code>Tell me a sunny song that is not against TV.\n</code></pre>\n<p>(44 characters)</p>\n<p>Now it adds the last bot message and your last question to the number of characters again.</p>\n<p>Answer:</p>\n<p>AI (should be 2919+486+44=3449):</p>\n<pre><code>#chars3039 #tokens439\n\nA sunny song that conveys a positive vibe without criticizing TV might be &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; by The Beatles. It’s an uplifting and cheerful song that celebrates the arrival of sunny days. Is there anything else you would like to know?\n</code></pre>\n<p>(263 characters)</p>\n<p>Thus, it makes a huge mistake here, likely it forgets to add its own last answer before the ongoing response. Someone with time can try to amend the task so that this does no longer happen. But even if you take out those 486, you will not reach 3039, since 2919+44=2963.</p>\n<p>Since I have spent too much time on tweaking this task, I shift any more changes to an unknown date.</p>\n<p>The chat would go on like this, always at first giving you the new numbers before the rest of the bot's answer. By this, you have a vague sum of the chat size at any time. That helps to know the size of your chat project, or if the chat is crashing, of if you want to guess the token costs on the run.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-06-11T01:46:20.910","Id":"1888","LastActivityDate":"2024-06-11T13:34:43.340","LastEditDate":"2024-06-11T13:34:43.340","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"3022","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"3022","ParentId":"1863","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"0","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

But this prompt doesn't seem to work well on <code>RAG</code>. It is making the bot too restrictive, and the bot refuses to answer some questions (like &quot;Who is the CEO of the XYZ company?&quot;) giving some security related excuse, even if the information is present in the provided context. I am following the formatting recommended by meta. But for open-book question-answering, the only modification I made is to add context. For example, the original prompt format is the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;s&gt;[INST] &lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;\n{{ system_prompt }}\n&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;\n\n{{ user_message }} [/INST]\n</code></pre>\n<p>After adding the context information, it changes as the following:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;s&gt;[INST] &lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;\n{{ system_prompt }}\n\n{{ context }}\n&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;\n\n{{ user_message }} [/INST]\n</code></pre>\n<p>But overall, the <code>LLAMA2</code> seems to be too stubborn and often ignores the instructions provided in the system prompt.

The major concern here is the proper context selection. There are some fundamental issues related to this. For example, you want to make a chatbot for an E-commerce site. So, you have downloaded the crawl of the whole site, and the crawl looks something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>Product Name: ABC\nDescription: [A moderately large description]\nPrice: $100\n\nProduct Name: DEF\nDescription: [A moderately large description]\nPrice: $200\n\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, you have to chunk the whole corpus and generate embeddings for each of them. The difficulties start from here. You cannot generate embedding for an arbitrarily large text. Also, even if you could do so, it would have a performance hit, as the passage will no longer be anything specific. Now, in the depicted scenario, after chunking there can be thousands of contexts that are very similar although they are referring to different products. Now during conversation, how do you ensure you are fetching the appropriate context for the correct product? As, after chunking the whole crawled data, the chunked passages may not contain any reference to the product at all and for many products, the passages can become almost equivalent.</p>\n<p>A similar situation happens when you work on documents. Like if you have a PDF content like:</p>\n<pre><code>An Overview of Machine Learning Techniques\n\n.........\n\nSVM\n[A description of SVM]\n\nWorking Example\n[An implementation of it]\n\nPros\n[Benefit of using this algorithm]\n\nCons\n[Describes when this is not applicable]\n\n.........\n\nNeural Network\n[A description of Neural Network]\n\nWorking Example\n[An implementation of it]\n\nPros\n[Benefit of using this algorithm]\n\nCons\n[Describes when this is not applicable]\n\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's assume, someone is chatting on a Neural Network topic. Now the user is asking the bot about its pros and cons. Now, there is no guarantee that the Pros and Cons related sections will contain the term &quot;Neural Network&quot; in them. The distance between the section and the last time the term &quot;Neural Network&quot; was mentioned can be so large that they cannot be inside of a single context. How do you handle this case? How do you carry forward the topic information on which the subsequent contexts are talking about? Also, there are some catches. There can be multiple levels of hierarchies (section, subsection, etc.), choosing the higher level can make the context too generalized, and choosing the lower level can make it too specialized. Taking all of them into consideration without hierarchy can be misleading.</p>\n<p>I have for example tried the <code>PyMuPDF</code> library to parse the headers and bold texts from a PDF. My target is to attach the most recent header to every other chunk where there is no header available. But in reality, you cannot always assume this will work. Even this approach fails in my local testing when I want to apply them to PDFs in the wild. Either the selected topic headers are too large in number or too less in number or they are simply generated as an artifact as people may not follow standard while writing documents, they can use those headers in inappropriate ways.</p>\n<p>I have been searching through the Internet for weeks, but most of the tutorials are only addressing the happy path, and almost no one is discussing this real issue that will arise when you want to apply it in wild situations.</p>\n<p>Is there any solution to this problem? Or is there any appropriate data structure to handle this kind of data? Is not Retrieval Augmented Generation applicable to this scenario?

,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>I want to augment to @NirO.'s answer. Yes, it is theoretically possible to recall the user's identity from the chat-history. But there are some practical issues here like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the chat becomes too long to get the interesting portion of your conversation in a single context window. Like, after user's identity related conversation, there can be a long thread of conversation and after that user may suddenly ask some question which will require to know their identity. In that case, it will easily overflow the context window and the model won't be able to find the id within its context (assuming that you are not summarizing the conversation and even if you do so it may lose some important information).</li>\n<li>The LLM can make mistakes even if the information is present there. As natural language can be ambiguous, the model may not understand it or misunderstand it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There can be some ways which can be helpful to fix this. Although none of them will give you an absolute guarantee on correctness:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Using Larger Context</strong>: Some LLMs have a very large context size. Like <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/LLaMA-2-7B-32K\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LLaMA-2-7B-32K</a>. This modified version of <code>LLAMA2</code> has 32K token context length. Using this may resolve your problem. But keep it in mind that, computing such a large context is computationally a heavy operation, even if you have deployed this model in your own server and don't care for the cost. In many cases it can be an overkill. Also, more context can make the response less focused to the current topic of conversation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Using Function Calling</strong>: This <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">option</a> is worth to consider. It can be used to generate structured output from unstructured input. You may collect user information when they provide it, and this can convert this to a structured output (data structure) which can be programmatically read and saved to the database. And during conversation, it can detect the need of function calling and based on that it can retrieve the necessary information from the database and the data can be converted back to the natural language when needed. If you want to develop your system with some LLM based framework like <code>Langhian</code>, then you may have a look on <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/chat/function_calling/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>. Also, check <a href=\"https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> to find which models are reliable in doing the tool/function calling. There are some other models which also support it apart from OpenAI models.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Hybrid (?)</strong>: I don't know how this will perform. But if you find the frequent function calling costly, then you may run a text classifier parallelly, which you can be trained with data such that it can predict such scenarios when and which function calls are needed. This model will just work like a flag which will notify you about a certain scenario like - user identity needed, username input, user phone number input, address input etc. Such that only after one of these intents is predicted with more than the pre-defined confidence threshold, you may call the LLM to do the conversation between natural language and data structure and vice versa when needed. This may reduce the API call overhead. Also, you can make use of NER (Named Entity Recognition) model which may help you to pick certain information from the user input. You can find more details <a href=\"https://monkeylearn.com/blog/named-entity-recognition/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. <a href=\"https://spacy.io/api/entityrecognizer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SpaCy</a> is a good library which provides pre-trained entity recognition model, and you can also train custom entity recognition model with it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Ostrich Algorithm</strong>: If you think that, it is okay for the bot to forget the user information sometimes when the information goes out of the context window and the user can happily re-input their information, then you can consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrich_algorithm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a>. JOKE APART! Sometimes, it might be okay if the bot forgets it. Or an easier solution can be including the user information with the prompt itself, if you already have collected it otherwise (say, from an input form).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"1","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-05-04T15:13:49.363","Id":"1811","LastActivityDate":"2024-05-04T18:36:50.567","LastEditDate":"2024-05-04T18:36:50.567","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"4598","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"4598","ParentId":"1730","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"1","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}
,{"AcceptedAnswerId":null,"AnswerCount":null,"Body":"<p>Yes. And interestingly enough, the GPT models actually work like that. Think of the typing suggestions in your phone's keyboard. It can give you suggestions for the next potential token typically based on previous a few tokens. Now think of a system which can give the next token suggestions based on previous thousands of tokens. GPTs are such a system. And the way it does so, is called autoregression and these models are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">autoregressive models</a>. Simply putting, an autoregressive model cascades its output to its input to generate next output. Which means, the generated text is fed back to the network to generate next token. For example, if you write like:</p>\n<pre><code>Once upon a time\n</code></pre>\n<p>The model will take this as an input an generate one of the possible next tokens like <code>in</code>. And this token will be appended to the existing input and again fed to the network to generate the second next token. So, in the second step the input is:</p>\n<pre><code>Once upon a time in\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the output can be <code>a</code>. Appending this again, we get the next input:</p>\n<pre><code>Once upon a time in a\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now if you continue like this you will get a text completion engine which will output coherent texts like this until it runs out of the maximum token length. So, the process is something like this (output from each step is represented inside [], and the rest tokens are the input tokens):</p>\n<pre><code>Your Input:  Once upon a time\n\nGeneration\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\nInput: Once upon a time [in]\nInput: Once upon a time in [a]\nInput: Once upon a time in a [land]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land [far]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land far [away]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land far away [there]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land far away there [existed]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land far away there existed [a]\nInput: Once upon a time in a land far away there existed a [kingdom]\n...\n</code></pre>\n<p>Each output is again sent back to the model as an input to get the next token. Anyway, you got the idea.</p>\n<p>Now, for use case, yes, it is possible to do so. Now let's analyze some technical aspects. As you are trying to use the GPTs as a text completion engine, without explicit prompt engineering. Then, you may use the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-base\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">base model</a>. These models are just like the text completion engine. They will complete the text anyway (that may not be always the most appropriate way with respect to your domain). But if you are okay with using prompts, then in that case, instead of using the base model use the <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chat models</a>. These models are already good at following instructions. You may just give it an idea of the domain such that it can generate more reliable and relevant text completions.</p>\n<p>Be note that, these models are trained with internet size data, so, they are capable of completing a text in astronomically various different ways. Not all of them might be applicable for your current use case. So, if you feel that the completion quality is not acceptable, even with prompting the chat model, then you may need to <a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fine tune</a> it, if you want the text completion to work in a relatively constrained way following the domain knowledge.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-05-04T13:25:05.167","Id":"1809","LastActivityDate":"2024-05-04T13:42:32.340","LastEditDate":"2024-05-04T13:42:32.340","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"4598","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"4598","ParentId":"1802","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"0","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

This represents the data as nodes and their relationships with edges. So, the main benefit of it is to allow you to ask questions which are not directly written anywhere in the documents.

This post has mentioned an overview when to choose which. Apart from that, I want to add something here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If your data is too variable, like - data from e-commerce site, real-time weather information etc. then it doesn't make sense to fine tune the model. As these data soon become obsolete. RAG is the way to go.</li>\n<li>Fine tuning is only beneficial for static/near static data, specially, when you are not getting satisfactory performance with RAG. This can be like when you want your model to reply in a very specific way which might your business requires, and RAG is not giving you that tone. Or, like you want to make the model skilled on a language when the existing model is not providing quality answers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>RAG</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cheap</li>\n<li>Fast to deploy</li>\n<li>Possible to implement in Real-Time domain</li>\n<li>You know from where the data is coming. So it is easy to validate the response, and which makes it relatively trustworthy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Limited context size may not allow you to cover prompt and context completely. May need to use summarization over selected contexts for this.</li>\n<li>Context can be broken into multiple chunks, which can make thing worse.</li>\n<li>Its performance not only depends on the LLM, but also depends on the context searching algorithm (typically, vector embedding search).</li>\n<li>Multiple contexts may become apparently identical but they do not belong to the same topic. So, it will increase the risks of wrong context selection, and which will lead to wrong answer. This problem is a nightmare! See this: <a href=\"https://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/126172/80430\">How to find proper context in open book question answering?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Fine Tuning</strong></p>\n<p>Pros:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can make LLM to perform well on cases where it already has some weakness on them. The weakness can be like language understanding, maintaining appropriate tone while replying, better understanding on a particular domain.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Time needed to train</li>\n<li>Can be costly depending on your data volume</li>\n<li>Not applicable for real-time case</li>\n<li>If you don't have enough data, then it is not for you</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, my personal suggestion will be to consider RAG initially. If you find that your model is not performing up to the mark in such a case which is crucial for your business, only then fine tune on that to make it more eligible to catch the behavior. And after that use RAG as usual (when applicable).</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-04-28T10:23:07.107","Id":"1800","LastActivityDate":"2024-04-29T09:24:04.347","LastEditDate":"2024-04-29T09:24:04.347","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"4598","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"4598","ParentId":"1766","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"1","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

However, it will make certain assumptions about a character based on what it &quot;knows&quot;.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/malfoyslastname/character-card-spec-v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Character Card V2 Specification</a> allows you to define the name of a character, a description of that character, its personality, and example conversations which are included until the context is overrun by your own conversation (as well as other more power user-y type fields I won't go into too much detail about here). This forms the basis of your &quot;character prompt&quot;. In supported frontends, this character prompt is passed along in a certain order to a text generation model, usually as a system instruction, along with the context of the current conversation, and (usually) a common system instruction to coerce the model into assuming the role of the character you defined in its responses.</p>\n<p><strong>The data in your character card is passed to the model as-is, and isn't automatically expanded upon.</strong> Meaning, the model won't usually try to make inferences about your character beyond what it already &quot;knows&quot; from the context and the model's dataset, and what you specify in your character card.</p>\n<p>What the model &quot;knows&quot; about a character from its training dataset can play a huge role in how it's portrayed in a conversation. For a character that's highly ingrained in popular culture, it's usually sufficient to just say that they are that particular character. For example, a description for Super Mario can be as short as:</p>\n<pre><code>{{char}} is Mario from the Super Mario series of video games.\n</code></pre>\n<p>The model can then make inferences about that character from its training dataset. Usually, you want to write your character descriptions and system instructions with as few tokens as possible, as that allows you to use more tokens for the context of a long or detailed conversation. For more obscure characters, or for your own original character, you will need to go into <em>far</em> more detail regarding physical appearance, personality, mannerisms, how it reacts to certain situations, along with a couple of example messages/conversations, to help steer the model in the right direction.</p>\n","ClosedDate":null,"CommentCount":"0","CommunityOwnedDate":null,"ContentLIcense":"CC BY-SA 4.0","CreationDate":"2024-08-20T07:16:30.217","Id":"1998","LastActivityDate":"2024-08-20T07:27:26.077","LastEditDate":"2024-08-20T07:27:26.077","LastEditorDisplayName":"","LastEditorUserId":"5327","OwnerDisplayName":null,"OwnerUserId":"5327","ParentId":"1996","PostTypeId":"2","Score":"3","Tags":null,"Title":null,"ViewCount":null,"file_path":"genai.stackexchange.com","file_type":"posts"}

In other words, you tend to have longer responses if set higher.</p>\n<p><strong>num_ctx</strong> sets the maximum context window to use, which is sort of the attention span of the model. In other words, if you have a large document you asked an LLM a question about you want the context length to be at least 1024, so that it will not forget what it read earlier than later.
